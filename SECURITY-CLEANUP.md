**Date Completed**: July 19, 2025  
**Action Taken**: Git history cleanup using orphan branch method  
**Result**: Repository is now safe for public access  

### What Was Done:
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded secrets from git history
- ✅ Implemented secure credential management via Kubernetes secrets
- ✅ Added comprehensive .gitignore for future protection
- ✅ Created template-based configuration system

### Current Security Measures:
- All secrets managed via Kubernetes secrets (not hardcoded)
- Build artifacts excluded from version control
- Credential files (.env, values.yaml) properly ignored
- Template files provided for team setup

### For Team Members:
To set up local development:
1. Copy template files: `cp values.yaml.template values.yaml`
2. Add your credentials to the local values.yaml files
3. values.yaml files are ignored by git and won't be committed
